MSc Finance Dissertation — LIBOR vs SONIA: Swaption Pricing Divergence Across Volatility Regimes
This repository contains my MSc Finance dissertation exploring how volatility regimes affected swaption pricing during the LIBOR–SONIA transition.  
The project investigates how differences in volatility behaviour between LIBOR- and SONIA-based swaptions led to pricing divergence, with implications for market risk and hedging accuracy.  

## Overview
The analysis was conducted using **MATLAB**, focusing on:
- Collecting and structuring market swaption data for volatility estimation  
- Cleaning and transforming datasets for model-based pricing analysis  
- Applying **Black** and **Bachelier** pricing models to assess volatility-driven pricing divergence  
- Evaluating how changes in volatility regimes impact model performance and rate transition dynamics  

## Key Findings
- Volatility patterns under SONIA exhibited lower dispersion compared to LIBOR across similar maturities.  
- Pricing divergence was most pronounced during periods of market stress and transition uncertainty.  
- Findings support improved understanding of model calibration and risk management under benchmark rate reform.
